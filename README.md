# Level 1 Task 9 -Beginner data structures: Arrays and maps

## Task 1

Follow these steps:

● Note: For this task you will need to create an HTML file to get input from a
user.

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called guestList.js.

● Ask the user to input names of people they would like to invite to a dinner
party.

● Each name should be added to an array.

● The user can only invite a maximum of ten people. If they try to add more
than 10 names, the program should state, “You have already added 10
people to your guest list.”

● The program should then output the list.

## Task 2

Follow these steps:

● You are now going to add more functionality to guestList.js.

● Now, if the user tries to add an 11th name to the array, the program should
say, “You have already added 10 people to your guest list. Would you like to
replace someone on the list with this person? y/n: ”

● If the user enters “y”, the program outputs the current guest list and then
asks, “Who would you like to replace?”

● The program then replaces the person the user specifies with the 11th
person given and outputs the updated list.

## Task 3

Follow these steps:

● Create a new JavaScript file in this folder called translator.js.

● You are going to create a map that can be used as a translator for a
language of your choice.

● Create a map with 10 key-value pairs, where the English word is the key,
and the translated word is the value.

● Ask the user what word they would like to translate.

● When the user inputs a word that is one of the keys, it should output the
corresponding value.
